          <p>
            Sigma comes from the “sigma male”, the newest pseudoscientific, male
            archetype based on a Greek letter; like alpha and beta. The sigma
            emerged from the manosphere in the early 2010s to describe a man
            whos just too unconventional to be considered an alpha or beta male.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those unfamiliar, the concept of alpha and beta males comes from
            the animal kingdom, particularly within social species like wolves.
            An alpha shows traits like confidence, dominance, strength, and
            leadership; while a beta is roughly the opposite: submissive,
            supportive, and passive.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Know Your Meme, a website dedicated to documenting
            internet phenomena,{" "}
            <strong>
              the sigma male is successful and popular, but also silent and
              rebellious, a type of man who likes to “play by his own rules.”
            </strong>{" "}
            In most analyses, they are considered “equal” to Alphas on the
            hierarchy but live outside of the hierarchy by choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Role models for the sigma include John Wick, Han Solo, and the
            infamous Patrick Bateman. Users of Urban Dictionary may have got it
            right when they describe the sigma as “what all 10 year olds think
            they are.”
          </p>
          <p className="my-4 text-xl font-bold">What are sigma memes?</p>
          <p>
            The sigma has become a basis for countless memes found across
            Reddit, X, and other platforms. Originally, sigma memes were sincere
            attempts to spread the word of this new male archetype, telling the
            world that the person behind the post was definitely the cool,
            mysterious type at least on social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sigma meme evolved to become ironic and satirical, taking a
            swipe at anyone who identifies as a sigma male and at the manosphere
            in general. Sigma memes often include an image of Patrick Bateman or
            Gus Fring from Breaking Bad with an overconfident quote the
            characters never actually said usually to explain how much
            richer/better/sexier the poster is than the person reading it.
