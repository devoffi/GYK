            <h2 className="font-bold mt-6 mb-2">We Comply With The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA)</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                COPPA and its rules require us to inform parents and legal guardians (“parents”) about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13 (“children”). It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child’s parent or confirm that the child’s teacher has obtained verifiable consent from such child’s parent, for certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child’s personal information.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Read more about COPPA at the FTC’s COPPA page. This regulation is designed to protect the privacy of your children. In order for a child under the age of 13 located in the United States to use the Safekidly Services, his/her parent or teacher must approve the registration.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                The Safekidly Services is designed for use in a household environment by parents and not by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under the age of 13. You warrant that (a) you have informed any Users that are 14 years old or more that the Monitored Devices used by them include control and monitoring software and have obtained authorization from such Users for this kind of activity or (b) there are rules in your country that exempt you from the aforementioned obligation of information and consent, or provides for a different age limit, in which case that age limit will apply. Both Safekidly and you agree to fully comply with this Privacy Policy.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Safekidly Processing User Data as Data Processor/Service Provider</h2>
      <p>
        When registering and creating an Account, Safekidly starts collecting data from the Devices associated with the Account, which may include personal data relating to you, Users of the Devices, or third parties (“<b>User Data</b>”, including information about your Devices, websites and apps that your Users use, contacts, connections, payments, messages and other communications, posted and received content, etc.). Furthermore, in the event of any promotional or other campaign, Safekidly may process the contact information (name and email address) of a potential new client or user of our Services you provide us with.
      </p>
      <p>
        We, as data processor under the GDPR and service provider under the CCPA, process User Data under instruction from you (our customer, the “Client”), acting as data controller. This means that you are in control of this data: you determine which data is collected and how it is used for your parental control purposes. 
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">1. Object and Term</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this section is to regulate the processing of the User Data indicated in Appendix 1, that you make available to Safekidly for us to provide you with the Safekidly Service. The term of validity of this section is established by virtue of your subscription with Safekidly.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Warranty and Indemnity</h2>
      <p>
        You, as the person responsible for User Data that we process on your behalf, represent and warrant to us that you have all the appropriate informed consents or other legal basis for processing from each and every data subject whose personal data are submitted to us in the course of the provision of the Services. You agree to indemnify and keep us harmless from all claims, damages, and losses we may suffer relating to or arising out of the processing of User Data and other third-party personal data submitted to our systems during the course of use and provision of the Services.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Your Use of User Data</h2>
      <p>
        As Data Controller, you warrant that you have the appropriate authority to collect and process the User Data and any other data you provide us with. You will not submit to the Services any personal data relating to any individual over 13 that has not authorized such processing. Through the Services, you may also access a copy of the User Data collected by us on your behalf. You will protect the confidentiality of any accessible User Data and prevent access by or disclosure to any unauthorized third person.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Service Configuration and Data Processing Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        The Client is responsible for setting the parental control panel configurations on the Safekidly Platform that control the Services, the supervision and monitoring of activities, and determines the personal data to be covered. The installation of the Safekidly Device Software and your configuration of the control panel constitute instructions for us to process User Data on your behalf. The level and degree of such surveillance and monitoring are entirely under your control, and we will not be liable for any such configuration and control carried out by you. Furthermore, your support requests via email or phone also constitute instructions for us to process User Data, as long as processing User Data is necessary to help you with your request.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We store the User Data until you close your Account. After that period, we disassociate the personal data from the individual it refers to and use such disassociated data for internal research and analysis purposes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">6. Data Removal</h2>
      <p>
        During your subscription, we generally retain your User Data on an identifiable basis for 12-month periods, for providing our annual behavior report. Through the Platform control panel, you may delete all historical data saved at any time. This data will no longer be accessible and will be fully removed from our systems on the next back-up. If you wish to remove all the User Data in your Safekidly Account, please uninstall Safekidly from your devices and send an email, with a digital copy of your ID or other identification document to prove your identity, requiring the deletion of all the data we have about you and your Users. Once your identity is confirmed, we will immediately remove all Data from our active systems and back-ups within fifteen (15) days from confirmation of identity.
